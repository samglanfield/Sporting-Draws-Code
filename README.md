# Sporting-Draws-Code
This repository includes the R code used to simulate both the uniform and sequential methods for both the 2026 World Cup group stage draw and the 2022/23 UEFA Champions League round of 16 draw.


All the relevant files of R code are self contained and as such to run and determine the probabilities associated with certain matchups the code can be run as presented. 


The 2026 World Cup group stage draw features a major change in the format of the competition namely, 16 groups of 3 teams compared to the current system of 8 groups of 4 teams. This means that there is a greater number of qualification spots for each country and as such the current constraints may not be directly applicable as FIFA is still determining this. In order to perform the draw we assume that all the constraints are the same other than UEFA/EU teams can have at most 2 per group but not at least one as is the current constraint.
